                I have coached all levels of the game from U5-U23 through my 15+ years of coaching soccer.  I have worked for multiple clubs and schools in the Spokane area as a youth director, coaching director, and head coach.  I desire to serve coaches locally in Spokane by giving them tools to be more successful at engaging, retaining and developing players of all ages.
