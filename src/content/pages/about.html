    This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
    that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
    content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
    to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
    content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
    of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
    about making the content accessible and easy to read.

                Unveiling Our <span class="cs-color">Purpose</span>: Empowering <span class="cs-color">Communities</span> Through Soccer and Ubuntu <h1>
            <h2>What's Our Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of Ubuntu Spokane (US) is to provide exceptional coaching consulting and summer soccer camps that inspire and empower children of all ages and skill levels to become passionate, skilled, and compassionate soccer players. Our goal is to create a positive and inclusive soccer community in Spokane, based on the African philosophy of Ubuntu, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of all people and the importance of community. We believe that soccer has the power to bring people together, promote personal growth, and foster a sense of belonging, and we are committed to creating a safe and supportive environment where every player can thrive. Through our coaching consulting, and summer camps, we aim to instill the values of Courage, Accountability, Friendship, and Communication, which will serve coaches and players both on and off the field. Our purpose is to develop not only skilled coaches and soccer players, but also confident and compassionate individuals who will make a positive impact in their communities.
            </p>
            <h2>Behind The Name</h2>
            <h4>"U"</h4>
            <p>
                Stands for Ubuntu which is a South African term, meaning “I am because we are.”  It is the idea that we are better together than we are separate.  The reason I do what I do is for the betterment of the collective.  It is a belief that we can achieve so much more when we focus on the people around us. 
            </p>
            <h4>"S"</h4>
            <p>
                Stands for the sport of soccer.  Soccer is our passion, and we believe it can play a significant role in the lives of kids in our community.  If we can focus on practices that have a lasting impact on our kids, such as character and leadership, we can use soccer as a tool to change their lives.  We believe each kid’s positive experience starts with our community’s volunteer coaches.
